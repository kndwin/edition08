        Edition 08 was born out of the desire to bring minimalism to beauty. The
        sentiment is guided by a longing to simplify and refine, creating
        conscious lines of thoughtfully formulated cosmetics, staggered in
        timely releases, to form a capsule collection of hero products.
        <br />
        <br />
        Offerings present a range of beauty essentials, in nuanced colours,
        designed to enhance not overwhelm the wearer.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each release is considered and adaptive in order to integrate seamlessly
        into oneâ€™s makeup practice and take the complexity out of beauty.
